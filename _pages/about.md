I am a research fellow at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg). Previously, I obtained my PhD at NUS and I was previleged to be supervised by Prof. [Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/index.html). 
Before that, I received my BS in Mathematics from [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn), advised by Prof. Huajie Chen and Prof. Shihua Zhang.

Research
===
I am broadly interersted in both the theoretical limits and emprical applications of reinforcement learning and online learning (e.g., multi-armed bandits), with current emphasis on theoretically-guaranteed algorithmic design in Large Language Models. Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests!

  I am currently seeking postdoctoral positions. Please feel free to reach out!

<h3 class="nus-blue">Theoretically-grounded Applications of Reinforcement Learning</h3>
- Development of *practical* and *provably sound* reinforcement learning methods for decision-making during model training and deployment.

<h3 class="nus-blue">Reinforcement Learning and Bandit Algorithm</h3>
- Characterization of fundamental limits of decision-making under practical modeling assumptions (e.g., stationary v.s. non-stationary, single- v.s. multi-agent), possibly subject to realistic constraints (e.g., efficiency or risk requirements).
- Design of provable algorithms that approach the fundamental performance limits.

- [2026-01] I PhinisheD my PhD study! Great thanks to the support from everyone, especially my supervisor Prof. Vincent Tan! 
- [2026-01] Posted "[Demystifying the Slash Pattern in Attention: The Role of RoPE](https://fengzhuo.notion.site/Demystifying-the-Slash-Pattern-in-Attention-The-Role-of-RoPE-2e90750f8b0c817d9d92d33f81ffd87c)". We found RoPE is related to the emergence of slash patterns in attention matrices. Huge thanks to the amazing collaborators!
